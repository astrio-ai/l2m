# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This package has been renamed

**The `l2m` package is deprecated and will no longer receive updates.**

## Migration Instructions

Please uninstall `l2m` and install the new package `astrio-atlas`:

```bash
pip uninstall l2m
pip install astrio-atlas
```

## What Changed

- **Package name**: `l2m` → `astrio-atlas`
- **CLI command**: `l2m` → `atlas`

## Why the Change?

The project has been rebranded from "Legacy2Modern" (L2M) to "Atlas: Autonomous Transpilation for Legacy Application Systems" to better reflect its capabilities and scope.

**Note**: This package (`l2m`) will continue to work as a wrapper around `astrio-atlas`, but we strongly recommend migrating to the new package name.
