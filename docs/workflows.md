# Workflow Documentation

This document describes the LangGraph workflows in the Legacy2Modern multi-agent system.

## Overview

The system uses LangGraph to orchestrate agent interactions through structured workflows. Each workflow defines a specific sequence of agent executions and their dependencies.

## Workflow Types

### 1. Main Workflow

**Purpose**: Complete modernization process with all agents working together.

**Agents**: Analyzer → Planner → Executor → Reviewer → Tester → Validator

**Description**: The main workflow orchestrates all agents in sequence to perform a complete modernization of a legacy codebase.

**Input**: Codebase path, target language, modernization goals
**Output**: Fully modernized codebase with tests and validation

### 2. Legacy Analysis Workflow

**Purpose**: Focused on analyzing legacy codebases to understand their structure and functionality.

**Agents**: Analyzer

**Description**: This workflow focuses solely on analyzing legacy codebases to understand their structure, dependencies, and functionality.

**Input**: Codebase path, analysis type, options
**Output**: Detailed analysis results with structure, dependencies, and patterns

### 3. Modernization Workflow

**Purpose**: Code transformation and execution without full validation.

**Agents**: Planner → Executor → Validator

**Description**: This workflow focuses on planning and executing code transformations with basic validation.

**Input**: Analysis results, target language, modernization goals
**Output**: Transformed code with basic validation

### 4. Validation Workflow

**Purpose**: Testing and quality assurance for modernized code.

**Agents**: Reviewer → Tester → Validator

**Description**: This workflow focuses on reviewing, testing, and validating modernized code.

**Input**: Modernized code, quality standards, test requirements
**Output**: Quality review, test results, validation results

## Workflow Execution

### State Management

Workflows use LangGraph state management to track:

- **Input Parameters**: Initial workflow parameters
- **Agent Results**: Results from each agent execution
- **Intermediate State**: State between agent executions
- **Final Results**: Complete workflow results
- **Error Information**: Any errors that occurred during execution

### Agent Orchestration

Workflows orchestrate agents through:

1. **Sequential Execution**: Agents run in a specific order
2. **Conditional Execution**: Agents may be skipped based on conditions
3. **Parallel Execution**: Some agents can run in parallel
4. **Error Handling**: Workflows handle agent failures gracefully

### Workflow Control

Workflows implement control mechanisms:

- **Entry Points**: Where workflows begin execution
- **Exit Points**: Where workflows complete execution
- **Conditional Branches**: Different paths based on conditions
- **Error Handling**: How to handle failures and errors

## Workflow Configuration

### Global Settings

Workflows can be configured with:

- **Timeout**: Maximum execution time
- **Retry Count**: Number of retry attempts
- **Parallel Limit**: Maximum parallel executions
- **Error Handling**: How to handle errors

### Agent Settings

Individual agents can be configured with:

- **Timeout**: Agent-specific timeout
- **Retry Count**: Agent-specific retry count
- **Options**: Agent-specific options
- **Tools**: Available tools and their configuration

### Workflow Settings

Workflows can be configured with:

- **Execution Mode**: Sequential or parallel execution
- **Error Handling**: Strict or lenient error handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Enable or disable progress tracking
- **Logging**: Logging level and output

## Workflow Monitoring

### Execution Tracking

Workflows track:

- **Start Time**: When workflow execution begins
- **End Time**: When workflow execution completes
- **Duration**: Total execution time
- **Status**: Current execution status
- **Progress**: Percentage of completion

### Agent Tracking

Individual agents are tracked for:

- **Execution Time**: How long each agent takes
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Error Rate**: Frequency and types of errors

### Performance Metrics

Workflows collect performance metrics:

- **Throughput**: Number of workflows completed per unit time
- **Latency**: Average time to complete workflows
- **Resource Usage**: Overall resource consumption
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of workflow failures

## Workflow Error Handling

### Error Types

Workflows handle different types of errors:

- **Agent Errors**: Individual agent failures
- **Workflow Errors**: Workflow-level failures
- **System Errors**: System-level failures
- **Timeout Errors**: Execution timeouts

### Error Recovery

Workflows implement error recovery:

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry of failed agents
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- **Error Propagation**: How errors are passed between agents
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial success when some agents fail

### Error Reporting

Workflows report errors through:

- **Structured Logging**: Detailed error logs with context
- **Error Metrics**: Aggregated error statistics
- **Alert Systems**: Notifications for critical errors
- **Debug Information**: Detailed debugging information

## Workflow Testing

### Unit Testing

Individual workflows are tested with:

- **Mock Agents**: Simulated agent responses
- **Test Data**: Sample input data
- **Expected Results**: Expected workflow outcomes
- **Error Scenarios**: Testing error handling

### Integration Testing

Workflow interactions are tested with:

- **Real Agents**: Actual agent implementations
- **Real Data**: Realistic input data
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete workflow execution
- **Performance Testing**: Workflow performance under load

### End-to-End Testing

Complete workflows are tested with:

- **Real Codebases**: Actual legacy codebases
- **Full Execution**: Complete workflow execution
- **Result Validation**: Verification of final results
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Workflow performance metrics

## Workflow Development

### Creating New Workflows

To create new workflows:

1. **Define Workflow Structure**: Identify required agents and their sequence
2. **Implement Workflow Logic**: Create the workflow implementation
3. **Configure Workflow Settings**: Set up workflow configuration
4. **Add Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
5. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive test coverage
6. **Document Usage**: Document workflow capabilities and usage

### Workflow Best Practices

- **Keep Workflows Simple**: Avoid overly complex workflows
