# Agent Documentation

This document describes the specialized agents in the Legacy2Modern multi-agent system.

## Overview

The system consists of six specialized agents that work together to modernize legacy codebases. Each agent has specific responsibilities and capabilities.

## Agent Types

**Capabilities**:
- Code quality review
- Standards compliance checking
- Test case generation
- Documentation generation
- Best practice validation

**Tools**:
- Code Review Tool
- Quality Analyzer Tool
- Test Generator Tool

**Input**: Transformed code, quality standards, review criteria
**Output**: Quality review, standards analysis, test cases

### 5. Tester Agent

**Purpose**: Generates and runs tests to validate functionality preservation.

**Capabilities**:
- Test case generation
- Test execution
- Coverage analysis
- Regression testing
- Performance testing

**Tools**:
- Test Runner Tool
- Coverage Analyzer Tool
- Test Validator Tool

**Input**: Transformed code, test requirements, test framework
**Output**: Test results, coverage analysis, test validation

### 6. Validator Agent

**Purpose**: Performs final validation of modernized code to ensure it meets all requirements.

**Capabilities**:
- Final validation
- Compliance checking
- Integration testing
- Quality assurance
- Success verification

**Tools**:
- Final Validator Tool
- Compliance Checker Tool
- Integration Test Tool

**Input**: Modernized code, validation criteria, requirements
**Output**: Validation results, compliance check, integration tests

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through the LangGraph state system:

1. **State Sharing**: Agents share data through the global state
2. **Message Passing**: Agents can send messages to each other
3. **Event Handling**: Agents respond to events and state changes
4. **Error Propagation**: Errors are propagated through the state system

## Agent Lifecycle

Each agent follows a standard lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Agent is created and configured
2. **Execution**: Agent runs with input parameters
3. **Processing**: Agent processes data and performs tasks
4. **Output**: Agent produces results and updates state
5. **Cleanup**: Agent cleans up resources and finalizes

## Agent Configuration

Agents can be configured through:

- **Settings**: Global configuration settings
- **Options**: Agent-specific options
- **Tools**: Available tools and their configuration
- **Parameters**: Runtime parameters and inputs

## Agent Error Handling

Agents implement comprehensive error handling:

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Catching**: Errors are caught and handled gracefully
- **Error Reporting**: Errors are reported with context and details
- **Recovery**: Agents attempt to recover from errors when possible

## Agent Performance

Agents are optimized for performance:

- **Parallel Execution**: Agents can run in parallel where possible
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU usage are optimized
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid redundant processing
- **Streaming**: Large datasets are processed in streams

## Agent Testing

Agents are thoroughly tested:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual agent functionality is tested
- **Integration Tests**: Agent interactions are tested
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflows are tested
- **Performance Tests**: Agent performance is benchmarked

## Agent Monitoring

Agents are monitored for:

- **Execution Time**: How long agents take to complete tasks
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage during execution
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Error Rate**: Frequency and types of errors

## Agent Development

To develop new agents:

1. **Inherit from BaseAgent**: Create a new agent class
2. **Implement Required Methods**: Override abstract methods
3. **Add Tools**: Implement agent-specific tools
4. **Configure Settings**: Set up agent configuration
5. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive test coverage
6. **Document Usage**: Document agent capabilities and usage
