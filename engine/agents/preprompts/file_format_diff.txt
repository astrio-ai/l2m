## File Difference Formatting

**Original File**: {{original_file}}
**Modernized File**: {{modernized_file}}

### Changes Summary
{{changes_summary}}

### Diff Format Guidelines

1. **Unified Diff Format**: Use unified diff format with context lines
2. **Context Lines**: Include 3 lines of context before and after changes
3. **Change Indicators**: Use standard diff markers:
   - `@@` for hunk headers
   - `+` for added lines
   - `-` for removed lines
   - ` ` (space) for unchanged lines

4. **File Headers**: Include proper file headers with paths
5. **Line Numbers**: Include line numbers in hunk headers
6. **Descriptive Headers**: Add descriptive comments for major changes

### Example Format

```diff
--- a/original_file.js
+++ b/modernized_file.js
@@ -1,5 +1,8 @@
 // Original code
-var oldFunction = function() {
+// Modernized code
+import React from 'react';

+const newFunction = () => {
   // Implementation
 };
```
